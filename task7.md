# Task 7

### Static:

##### Advantages:
* Most effective for simple data (few variables and not too much data)
* Cheap to build
* Standardized ways of building them: There are already a few standard static visualization plot types that everybody is familiar with (line charts, scatter plots, histograms, etc.)
* Can be printed

##### Disadvantages:
* Sometimes isn't enough for visualizing complex data
* Depending on the audience, it can be "boring" in less serious settings
* Difficult to show the big picture and the details at the same time
* Difficult to get insights from your audience
* Data must be updated manually if it changes

### Interactive

##### Advantages:
* Possibility to show complex data
* The user has total control on what she wants to show, you can involve your audience more
* More efficient at captivating user's attention (if done right)
* Allows showing the big picture and the details at the same time
* Allows to get insights from your audience (for example you can track clicks to see what data gets the most attention)
* Data can be updated in real time

##### Disadvantages:
* Often it can be difficult to understand how the visualization works
* Often it can be more than necessary
* Expensive to build
* No standardized way of building them
* Cannot be printed

### Animated

##### Advantages:
* Like interactive, it allows us to show complex data
* Allows guiding the audience through what we want to show them
* More efficient at captivating user's attention (if done right)
* Allows showing the big picture and the details (at least some of them) at the same time

##### Disadvantages:

* Like interactive, expensive to build
* Often it can be more than necessary
* The viewer doesn't have control
* No standardized way of building them
* Difficult to get insights from your audience
